With regards to PID tuning:
- Kp is the proportional gain, which determines how hard the aircraft tries to pitch/yaw/roll to face your aim direction.
    - A good value to start at is around 4 for pitch and yaw, and 2 for roll.

- Ki is the integral gain, which generally you won't need to touch.
- KiMax is the maximum integral value, and again, you generally won't need to touch this.
- Kd is the derivative gain, which stops the aircraft from oscillating around your aim direction. This can be thought of as damping.
    - A good value to start at is around 20 for pitch and yaw, and 1 for roll
